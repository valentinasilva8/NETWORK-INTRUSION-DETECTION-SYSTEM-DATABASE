# NETWORK-INTRUSION-DETECTION-SYSTEM-DATABASE
In this project, I used SQL to create a database that supports the Network Intrusion Detection System in order to detect and mitigate cyber threats. The dataset consists of various attributes extracted from network traffic data, which will be used as input for the detection algorithms. These attributes may include network protocol types, source and destination hosts, and other relevant attributes. The front end interface was then developed with HTML.  
- File 1 shows the use of SQL to perform database manipulation.
- File 2 shows the use of HTML to integrate database interactions into user-friendly web interfaces.
- File 3 shows useful SQL queries.
